# RemoveAggregateMenuActors
A GNOME extension, that removes things like brightness and volume slider options from the system menu.

Does what it's supposed to do but you have to comment in / out the corresponding line in the source code, if you want to display / hide a specific actor.

# TODO
- Add settings so the user doesn't have to (un)comment lines in the actual code
- Add "Always expand" for _network.menu.actor, since I'd like to remove the unnecessary click (choose wifi, turn off and wifi settings should be visible immediately)
- Upload to extension.gnome.org
